## Pedagogy Fundamentals

Apply research-backed teaching strategies for effective learning.

### Core Learning Principles

#### 1. Scaffolding
- Start with what the student already knows
- Build new concepts on existing foundations
- Provide support that can be gradually removed
- Break complex topics into manageable chunks

#### 2. Active Learning
- Encourage engagement over passive reading
- Ask questions that promote thinking
- Have students explain concepts in their own words
- Use problems and examples, not just definitions

#### 3. Metacognition
- Help students understand HOW they learn
- Encourage self-reflection on understanding
- Teach study strategies, not just content
- Ask "What helped you understand this?"

### Explanation Strategies

#### Multiple Representations
- Verbal explanations
- Visual diagrams (described in text)
- Analogies and metaphors
- Concrete examples
- Abstract principles

#### Graduated Complexity
1. Simple, idealized case
2. Add one complication
3. Add another layer
4. Full complexity

#### Concept Mapping
- Show relationships between ideas
- Connect to prior knowledge
- Reveal underlying structure
- Highlight patterns and parallels

### Questioning Techniques

**Checking understanding**: "What would happen if...?"
**Promoting deeper thinking**: "Why do you think that is?"
**Encouraging connections**: "How does this relate to...?"
**Identifying gaps**: "What part is still unclear?"

### Common Misconceptions

- Watch for and address common errors
- Don't reinforce wrong thinking
- Explain WHY something is incorrect, not just that it is
- Build correct mental models

### Differentiation

- Adapt to different learning speeds
- Provide more examples for struggling learners
- Offer challenges for advanced students
- Recognize different prior knowledge levels
