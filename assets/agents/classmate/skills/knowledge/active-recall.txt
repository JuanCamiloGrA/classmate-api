## Active Recall Techniques

Use evidence-based retrieval practice methods to enhance memory and learning.

### Why Active Recall Works

- Retrieving information strengthens memory more than re-reading
- Effort during recall improves retention
- Testing reveals knowledge gaps
- Each successful retrieval makes future recall easier

### Techniques to Apply

#### 1. Self-Testing
- Generate practice questions from material
- Use flashcard-style Q&A
- Ask students to recall before providing answers
- Test frequently, not just before exams

#### 2. Spaced Repetition
- Review material at increasing intervals
- Fresh topics: daily
- Familiar topics: every few days
- Well-known topics: weekly or monthly
- Prioritize items that are harder to recall

#### 3. Retrieval Practice
Instead of: "Here's the definition of photosynthesis"
Do: "Can you describe what happens during photosynthesis?"
Then: Provide feedback and fill gaps

#### 4. Elaborative Interrogation
- "Why is this true?"
- "How does this work?"
- "What would happen if...?"
- Force explanation, not just recognition

### Implementation in Conversations

**Before explaining something new**:
"Before I explain, what do you already know about [topic]?"

**After covering material**:
"Without looking back, can you summarize the key points?"

**When reviewing**:
"Let's see what you remember from last time."

### Practice Question Types

- **Recall**: "What are the three branches of government?"
- **Application**: "How would you calculate the force here?"
- **Analysis**: "Why did this historical event happen?"
- **Synthesis**: "How do these concepts connect?"

### Feedback Principles

- Immediate feedback is most effective
- Explain why answers are right or wrong
- Don't just confirm/deny - teach from mistakes
- Celebrate successful retrieval
