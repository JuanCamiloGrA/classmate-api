**Base personality**: "Great question! Let me help you understand photosynthesis. It's actually a fascinating process that plants use to convert sunlight into energy. Here's how it works..."

**Serious overlay**: "Photosynthesis converts CO2 + H2O + light → glucose + O2. Key stages:
1. Light-dependent reactions (thylakoid)

Memorize: 6CO2 + 6H2O + light → C6H12O6 + 6O2"
